- OTP code generation and email sending using PHPMailer library
- OTP verification and account activation
- User login and logout
- Simple dashboard with user information

## Requirements

- PHP 5.6 or higher
- MySQL 5.6 or higher
- PHPMailer library (included in the project)

## Installation

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```
   git clone https://github.com/stewert69/OTP-Verification-System.git

2. Create a new MySQL database and import the `otp.sql` file from the project's `database` folder.

3. Update the database connection settings in the `Connection.php` file:

   ````php
   $conn = mysqli_connect('localhost', 'root', '', 'otp');
   ```

   $mail->Username = 'your-email@gmail.com'; // SMTP username
   $mail->Password = 'your-email-password'; // SMTP password
   $mail->setFrom('your-email@gmail.com'); // Sender email address
   ```

5. Start a PHP server on your local machine:

   ````
   php -S localhost:8000
